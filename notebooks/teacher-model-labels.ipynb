    "- [Earnings]: Reports of quarterly, monthly, etc. concrete values of revenue, ESP, etc. Percentage fluctations.\n",
    "              Expected values are not Earnings and should be Guidance instead!\n",
    "- [Labour Issues]: Mentions of layoffs, union action, strikes, rising cost of labour, bonuses for execs, etc. Important personal change, e.g. CEO, CFO, VPs, etc.\n",
    "- [Mergers and Acquisitions]: Whenever merging or acquisition of entities, not just companies, is mentioned.\n",

    "                          Takes priority over Earnings, Stock Price Movement, Credit Ratings\n",
    "- [Credit Ratings]: Adjustments of company's borrowing capacity, changes in debt values, changes in ratings, etc.\n",
    "- [Products-Services]: Mentions of a company's particular product, forward-looking product directions, disruption, government and private contracts, etc.\n",
